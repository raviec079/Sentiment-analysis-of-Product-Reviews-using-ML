# Sentiment-analysis-of-Product-Reviews-using-ML
The rise of e-commerce has revolutionised the way people make purchasing decisions. With 
the availability of numerous products and brands at the click of a button, customers heavily 
rely on the opinions and experiences of other customers to make informed decisions. Online 
customer reviews, therefore, have become a critical source of information for both customers 
and businesses. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims 
to automate the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a text document, such as a 
customer review. 
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews to 
understand the overall sentiment of customers towards a product. The insights from this 
analysis can provide valuable information to companies and sellers in improving their 
products and customer satisfaction. Various machine learning and deep learning models can 
be used for the same. 
The results of the sentiment analysis are presented in the form of visualisations and statistical 
analysis, allowing for easy interpretation of the findings. The report provides a 
comprehensive overview of the sentiment analysis performed on the product reviews data. 
In conclusion, sentiment analysis on customer reviews has the potential to provide valuable 
insights into customer opinions and preferences.
In conclusion, the project successfully employed sentiment analysis on Amazon product 
reviews using five different machine learning models. After comparing the accuracy of each 
model, it was found that the SVM model performed the best, and you were able to further 
increase its accuracy through fine tuning.
Additionally, you developed a website that utilises this model to classify reviews as positive, 
negative, or neutral. This website provides a user-friendly interface that can aid individuals in 
making more informed purchasing decisions based on the sentiment of reviews.
Overall, your project showcases the effectiveness of machine learning in sentiment analysis 
and demonstrates its potential application in the field of e-commerce.
